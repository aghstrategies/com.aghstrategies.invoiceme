This Extension
--------------

Whenever a pending pay later contribution is successfully created by a logged in user (front or back end) this extension creates a yellow box with a link to print an invoice.

Configuration: enable this extension and the permission "CiviCRM: view my invoices Allow users to view/ download their own invoices".
